# CanvasTodoist 
An automated way to pull all assignments from the Canvas Dashboard to Todoist. 

## Register API tokens 
This script uses API tokens to work.

### Todoist
Input your Todoist API token in Tokens/todoist.txt. In order to get your API token go to [https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations).
### Canvas
Input your Canvas API token in Tokens/canvas.txt. 
To generate a token for Canvas:
1. Go to Canvas and click the "profile" link in the top right menu bar, or navigate to /profile
2. Under the "Approved Integrations" section, click the button to generate a new access token.
3. Once the token is generated, you cannot view it again, and you'll have to generate a new token if you forget it. Remember that access tokens are password equivalent, so keep it secret.
